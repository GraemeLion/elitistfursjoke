			<h4>Why did you do this?</H4>
			<p> Because I was sick of seeing people arguing that various groups in furry are elitst </p>

			<h4>Do you think every group is elitist?</h4>
			<p> No.  Yes.  I think many groups in furry tend to not realize how they treat people trying to break into their group.  Are they elitist or not if they just don't know how to welcome others? I guess that's up to you.</p>

			<h4>Can you make a site for me?</h4>
			<p>I'd rather not, but you can fork this one and play around with it :D</p>
			
			<h4>You must be a sad person to call all these people elitist.</h4>
			<p>I'm not.  If you put 'GraemeLion' in there , or 'coderfurs', or any group I'm in, it says 'YES' to that , too.  If I really were mean, I'd have it single my groups out, and then I really would be elitist. :D</p>

			<h4>What else are you planning on doing with this site?</h4>
			<p>I probably will introduce some way to track the last ten items entered, or do some metrics, there may be some interesting statistical implications of this site.</p>

			<h4>How can I reach you?</h4>
